# QT {QML + CPP} Tesla IVI Clone

## Motivation

I have always wanted to start a side project to learn how to setup a QT app that does something (not too complex) as I am learning a new thing, (actually not really new, I have already used QT with python) but it was once and I did it really long ago.

So I was motivated when I was doing something, well I can't say the exact reason because my manager won't like it :D "let the reader imagine". Anyway, I will let you with the real content here.

### Idea of The Program

The idea of the program is to find a good idea that's the ðŸš— automotive flavor (since I am working in this industry ðŸ˜…), after a couple of searches I found a good tutorial that is doing exactly what I want, and I was really inspired by [Monty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tq-E6lqO6tM).

Tesla IVI (In-Vehicle-Infotainment) UI was what I was searching for, so I did watch the begining of his tutorial and at later stages -once I got the hang of it- I was doing the step and then I watch Monty descibing it and fixing my code if I had some bad design or implementation or sometimes I push thing further if I was caught into it ðŸ˜€.

Things that I learnt from the tutorial:

* QML anchors and how to easily place the UI elements.
* How to bind the C++ code with the QML engine to be able to handle C++ getters , setters, and invokables (fancy word for functions ðŸ˜…).
* How to add resources like images using (.qrc) files.
* How to use the awesome features of refactoring of QT Creator IDE, like: Creating definitions quickly from Q_PROPERTY and also creating setters and getters blazingly fast.
* How to divide the backend code and the UI, applying one of the common paradigms for designing UI appliactions (view/controller). Which absolutely creates a good separation of concerns.

## Installation

First thing I pumped at is the installation of the QT, though the commercial version sounds fun to install rather than the
